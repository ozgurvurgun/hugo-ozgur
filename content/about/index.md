Hi,

I'm Özgür Vurgun — a software developer.  
I mainly focus on backend development, system tinkering, automation, and building tools that make my own work easier.

Besides my daily work, I enjoy trying out new languages, exploring frameworks, and understanding how things work *from the root*.  
When I write code, I care as much about *why* something is done a certain way as *how* it’s done. Sometimes, I build the same thing three times in different ways — just to see how it really works under the hood.

I prefer *clean systems*, *noise-free tools*, and setups that don't get in the way.  
I usually stay away from frontend work and stick to backend and automation.  
Sometimes my experiments turn into CLI tools, small bots, or just random notes here on this blog.

This blog is where I put all these scribbles, ideas, and the occasional *“oh, so that’s how it works”* moment.
