Hello,

I'm Emre, a software developer by trade.

On this blog, I share insights about software, pen my personal thoughts, and even dabble in some poetry. Hugo is my chosen platform for expressing these musings. You can find links to my other online profiles at the bottom of this page.

Feel free to drop me a line if you ever want to discuss topics X, Y, or Z. You can reach me at z[at]emre[dot]xyz.

Just a heads-up, if you're expecting an email from me and haven't received it yet, do take a moment to check your spam folder. Many email clients aren't too fond of messages from domains that end with .xyz.

Stay safe and take care!
