 I realized there is `visibilitychange` event in web api when I enter instagram on pc, and the instagram stops playin reels when i go to another tab. I didn't know that event exists. You can know the tab is visible or hidden with that. [mozmdn-visibilitychange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/visibilitychange_event)
