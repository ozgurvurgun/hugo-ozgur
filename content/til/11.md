 I recently decided to give the Zed editor a try. I've been using Vim for years (and Linux-as-an-IDE), but Zed caught my eye with its modern features, so I thought I'd check it out.

Everything about Zed seems great, and I honestly think it's one of the best editors out there. However, I couldn't shake the feeling of something being off, even when using Vim mode. Now I understand why they mention it's 90% compatible with Vim.

In the end, I'll be sticking with Vim and Linux-as-an-IDE. But I do recommend that every developer give Zed a shotâ€”it's worth exploring. You can check it out at [zed.dev](https://zed.dev).
