Recently, I embarked on a journey with [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/), an app that promises to unify all your messaging applications into one. The idea of having a single hub for all my conversations was intriguing, and I was eager to see how it would pan out. Here are my thoughts after a few weeks of using Beeper.

## The Promise of Unity

The concept of Beeper, a one-stop-shop for all messaging apps, is a compelling one. However, as I realized(finally lol), each messaging app has its unique features that make it special. Translating these unique features into a single app is a Herculean task, and it's understandable if some features get lost in translation.

## The Beeper Experience

### Telegram on Beeper

I started my Beeper journey on my Mac, integrating it first with Telegram. It was a breeze to see all my message history and groups in one place. However, I missed some of Telegram's unique features like group searching, group detail view, adding users to groups, and sharing group links. As a result, I found myself keeping Telegram installed alongside Beeper.

### WhatsApp on Beeper

Next, I integrated WhatsApp. While the basic messaging function worked well, I found that video-audio chats, status shares, and separated views for files and media were missing. This meant that I had to keep WhatsApp installed as well.

### Android SMS Gateway on Beeper

When I integrated the Android SMS gateway, I had to install Beeper on my phone. It was convenient to have all my integrations on my phone, but I soon noticed that I was receiving duplicate notifications - one from Beeper and one from the original app. This was a bit overwhelming, and I found no way to disable notifications by integration. However, I didn't want to disable all Beeper notifications as it had become my default SMS app.

### Slack on Beeper

Integrating Slack brought a unique challenge. Finding the right Slack group via search in Beeper was tricky, as it always included "slackbot" as a second user in the chat. For instance, if I searched for "Daniel," I would see "Daniel & Slackbot." This was a bit confusing. Additionally, I missed the thread feature that Slack offers.

### Discord on Beeper

Finally, when I integrated Discord, I had to bid farewell to audio chats, a key feature of Discord that I use frequently.

## The Verdict

In summary, while Beeper's mission to assemble all messaging apps into one is ambitious and innovative, it still has some way to go in terms of UI/UX. The Beeper inbox tends to get crowded quickly, making it easy to lose track of conversations.

## Suggestions for Beeper

Despite my decision to stop using Beeper for now, I believe in its potential and look forward to future updates. Here are a few suggestions for the Beeper team:

1. Consider allowing users to disable notifications by integration to avoid notification overload.
2. Improve the search function, especially for Slack integration, to make it more user-friendly.
3. Work towards integrating more features from the original apps, like audio chats for Discord and group details for Telegram.

Beeper is a step towards a future where we can manage all our conversations in one place. With some improvements, it could become a game-changer in the world of messaging apps.
